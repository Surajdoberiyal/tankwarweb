# TankWarWeb
THE TANK WARS........
This website is an initiative under the outreach department of Tank Wars Game project,
along with outreach it focuses on the academic development of those who worked on this;
therefore the website is made from scratch using HTML, CSS AND Vanilla JavaScript Web
Technologies.
TankWars_Promo features include:
>> Game themed website: Our attempt was to create a website that represents what we are
selling (Video Game), thus we tried to give it a creative look by making the website look like
game.
>> Introduction page: Like other events start with a bang, this website also opens with an
animation of firing a missile (Bang) using an on load event.
>> Gallery: This contains glimpse of what we are offering in a creative Slider form in an
iframe tag. Array of 5 images that translates (along-X) and rotates (along-Y) simultaneously,
all in a perspective view.
Functioning: This continuous slider works on the object oriented principal. A
Function that simulates class which contains ‘move’ and ‘check’ function which refer
to the current object using 'this' keyword; each object of the class contains an image.
>> Information page: contains the APK and Google Play link to the game, also tells the
features of our game like Sandbox Blog, Tournament, Policy.
>> Feedback: Our site consist a feedback with which user can share extra reviews to the
developers of the game. Users’ valuable feedback would help us in improving and
optimising the function of the game.
Functioning: Our feedback form extracts the information from the input fields of the
form i.e. the email, name, score, and feedback and stores it into a variable that is in
turn displayed on the console. When we will connect our website to the database
this stored feed will be directly forwarded to our database to our developers and
hence the information (your suggestions/feedback) would be used for further
enhancements and optimising the game.
